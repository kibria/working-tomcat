      <h3>Welcome to Content Studio</h3>
      <p>Escenic Content Studio is the content creation, editing and management application of the Escenic content management system. It is the system's "front end", the most visible part of the system, and is intended to be used on a daily basis by the writers and editors responsible for the content of an Escenic-managed web site.</p>
      <p>If you're new to Content Studio, it's probably a good idea to browse through the User Guide before you start. If you're too impatient for that, then you could try to:<br/>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a new content item by clicking File > New in the menu bar, or</li>
          <li>Display the Search panel by clicking on the Search button at the top of the left side of the window. You can use this panel to search for existing content items and open one for editing.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        <!--<img src="Getting-started.png">--><br/>
      </p>
      <h3>New in version <span>5.7</span></h3>
      
      
      <h4>Multi-device preview</h4>
      <p>Content Studio has a completely new, improved preview function for content items and section pages. Previews are now displayed on a tab in the section page/content item editor, and you can switch between large, small and medium options to see how the page looks on different devices. The large, small and medium options can each be set to a range of different resolutions, allowing you to preview many different device sizes. The new preview function also has a time control which lets you preview a page's appearance at different times in the future, so you can see the effects of planned publish/expiry events. The preview tabs can be undocked into a separate window.</p>

      <h4>Moving sections</h4>
      <p>You can now use Content Studio to move sections to different locations in the section tree and move all of a section's content items to a new section.</p>

      <h4>Pinning list items</h4>
      <p>You can now pin list items in position, so that they do not move up or down when other list items and added and removed.</p>

      <h4>Performance monitor</h4>
      <p>A new performance monitor in the Content Studio status bar will alert you if the Content Engine's performance drops below specified levels.</p>

      <h4>Dockable related content area</h4>
      <p>Content editors' related content areas are now dockable.</p>

      <h4>And for developers...</h4>
      <p>It's now possible to extend Content Studio's search function so that it can search in any external data sources that provide an OpenSearch interface. Such external searches can be fully integrated with the standard search functionality.</p>
